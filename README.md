# DHCAL-linearity-correction
Felix St-Amour PHYS-479 project under Prof. Corriveau

This repo contains the final report as well as the code created and the data found for the linearity correction project.

Please note that the report contains the references for the poster showcase of April 7th 2025.

modGaussianTrueFit.cc contains the code with the linearity correction algorithm. It outputs the histograms for the number of hits.

PlotHitsVsEnergy.cc plots the hits as a function of energy and fits the linearity. It also outputs the ratio plots.

PlotRes.cc plots the hit resolution.
